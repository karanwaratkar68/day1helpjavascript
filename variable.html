Variable stores a single data value that can be changed later.
Variables can be defined using var keyword. Variables defined without var keyword become global variables.
Variables must be initialized before using.
Multiple variables can be defined in a single line. e.g. var one = 1, two = 2, three = "three";
Variables in JavaScript are loosely-typed variables. It can store value of any data type through out it's life time.
